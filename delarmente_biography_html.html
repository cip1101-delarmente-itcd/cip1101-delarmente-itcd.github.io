    <h2 align = "center" > Childhood Years</h2>

    <p><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I was a child, I was happy and carefree.<sup>1</sup> Childhood years are the time when we had nothing to worry about.<sup>2</sup> I am free to do anything and only spent my time playing with my friends and family.<sup>3</sup> I used to play a lot with my friends outside in the vacant lot.<sup>4</sup> We played so many games that we forgot the time.<sup>5</sup> My favorite game was the <b>"Tumbang preso"</b> because my slippers is thick and it is called <b>Rambo</b>.<sup>6</sup> I have the advantage in that game that's why I was so happy when we play that game and my teammate used to borrow another pair that's why we always dominate the game.<sup>7</sup> Another game that I play with my friends is basketball and my father is the one that introduce that game to us because he was varsity in his high school days that's why he decided to teach us how to play the game.<sup>8</sup> He taught us how to shoot and the fundamentals of dribbling the ball.<sup>9</sup> He also made us the basketball ring and put it in the vacant lot outside our house.<sup>10</sup> I love playing basketball to the point that I have many bruises on my legs because of playing too much.<sup>11</sup> I enjoyed my childhood years but when it comes to my elementary days it is worse because I am a crybaby.<sup>12</sup> Every time my mother took me to school I always cry because I don't want my mom to leave me and I am afraid that my teacher will scold me.<sup>13</sup> The reason why I always cry in our school is because of the movie <strong>"Paranormal Activity 1"</strong> I was traumatized to the point that I will cry when my mom leave my side.<sup>14</sup> That time I always remember the scene where the ghost pulls the girl out of her bed that's why I don't want my mom to leave because of the fear that it will happen to me.<sup>15</sup> In addition to this, the second reason why I cry is that my teacher at that time was so terrifying that every sound that students make he will shout.<sup>16</sup> That's why my mother requested to the admin that I will be moved to the second section.<sup>17</sup> My tantrum stops when I am in the 2<sup>nd</sup> section because my teacher at that time is kind and I am with my friends in the previous grade.<sup>18</sup> I am always thankful to my teacher in 3 <sup>rd</sup> grade because she help me overcome my fear and always said to me that I can do it.<sup>19</sup> Overall, In everything that I had experienced from this time of my chilhood, both good and bad will always remain a lesson for me.<sup>20</sup> </blockquote></p>

    <h2 align = "center"  > Teenage Years</h2>
    <p><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In my teenage years, I enrolled in <b>"Quezon City Academy"</b> as a junior high.<sup>1</sup> My school is close to SM North Edsa and our home.<sup>2</sup> When my parents enrolled me in this school I was afraid because they have this required haircut like in the military but they tell me not to worry because I'll get used to it.<sup>3</sup> On my first day in class, I felt that I do not belong here because my friend is in another school.<sup>4</sup> I was nervous at that time because my adviser at that time is scary but it turns out that he was pranking us and this is his way of welcoming new students.<sup>5</sup> I'm glad that I made a lot of friends in my section and I found out that their hobby is playing basketball too that's why we created a group chat on Facebook called <strong>Splash Brothers</strong>.<sup>6</sup> The reason we called it Splash Brothers is because that time the trending basketball team is <b>"Golden State Warriors"</b>and their team is so good at scoring that's why we are inspired by them.<sup>7</sup> They are my classmates until 4<sup>th</sup> year that's why they are the reason that my junior high school days is so happy.<sup>8</sup> Basketball is a sport in our school that's why every section has a team that represents them.<sup>9</sup> I remember that the other section cannot beat us because our group is full of tall people and even our point guard is so tall.<sup>10</sup> We used to play in the nearest court every Friday and we always had a betting game so that after the game we can buy food and water.<sup>11</sup> After playing basketball, we go the computer shop and play <b>"League of Legends"</b> for 2 hours.<sup>12</sup> This game is like <b>Mobile Legends</b> where you fight each other until you destroy the last tower in the base.<sup>13</sup> In our school, The other teacher calls us the worst section because we are so noisy and my friends always tell a funny joke that will make the class laugh.<sup>14</sup> But it is okay to us that we are called worst section because my classmates are very talented to the point that we won the events like foundation day, intrams etc.<sup>15</sup> We are happy that we beat the advisory section of the teachers that call us the worst section.<sup>16</sup> After we graduate from junior high school, my friends and I enrolled in senior high school at <b>"National University"</b> and we spent another 2 years of fun.<sup>17</sup> We always like to play billiards after school and play computer games at <b>Mineski Computer Shop. </b><sup>18</sup>Overall, My teenage years are the best part of life because this is the part where I explore and experienced many things that make me happy.<sup>19</sup> I am thankful to my friends and teachers because they are the ones that teach me how to enjoy life.<sup>20</sup> That's why I wish that I can turn back the time so that we can bond again.<sup>21</sup> </blockquote></p>

    <h2 align = "center"  > College Years</h2>
    <p><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In my college years, I enrolled at the <strong>University of the East</strong> as a Bachelors of Science in Information Technology also known as BSIT.<sup>1</sup> The reason why I enrolled in UE is that my brother said that it is one of the best schools that teach IT programs.<sup>2</sup> My two siblings graduated from UE that's why they recommend that I must enroll in UE. <sup>3</sup>  My first choice is to continue studying at <strong>National University </strong> as a BSIT but they pushed me to enroll in UE that's why I don't have a choice because it is my parents choice.<sup>4</sup> I am sad because we did not have any face-to-face interaction because of the pandemic.<sup>5</sup> This pandemic in our country will stay for long because our government is taking advantage of their powers and they don't have a proper way of fixing it. <sup>6</sup> That's why all the people who study and teach are suffering because of what government does to our country. <sup>7</sup> Studying in this new online learning is hard because you are only in front of your computer every day and doing assignments until you finish it. <sup>8</sup> I got nervous on the first day because I don't know how to interact with my classmates but I'm glad that I met many friends that are fun to chat with. <sup>9</sup> When you are taking online classes in this pandemic you must remember every time to <strong>"Think before you click"</strong> because if you do something wrong it will cause a problem to other students or your teachers.<sup>10</sup> Online class for me is very hard because this routine that I had every day is exhausting and we don't have free time to do other things like playing or bonding with friends.<sup>11</sup> The worst day of my college years is when I got positive with COVID because it is hard to balance the studies when you are sick. <sup>12</sup> The anxiety and stress when you have COVID is interrupting your studying to the point that you just want to rest in the bed for the whole day. <sup>13</sup> But I am thankful that I survived it and I am already negative to the test that we do. <sup>14</sup> I am grateful to my friends that time because they always reminded me to have positive thinking and always pray to God that I will survive this COVID. <sup>15</sup> I am still hoping that this pandemic will end soon because I want to experience face-to-face classes and I want to meet my friends in college.<sup>16</sup> I also want to experience the facilities in the UE because the only time that I experience it is when I take the entrance exam. <sup>17</sup> But I don't have a choice in this new way of learning because it is the way to keep us safe from the virus. <sup>18</sup> I need to face challenging problems and always think positively because I need it to achieve my dream and to help my family.<sup>19</sup> All those sacrifices and darkest hours in my life will remain in my heart as proof of having God as my savior.<sup>20</sup> Everything might be uncertain but hold on for one-day things will be brighter.<sup>21</sup>  Do not lose hope, trust God, and la vie continue!.<sup>22</sup>
